= A Guide to Using this Application

== Developers Guide
=== Prerequisites

* You must have Java 11 or higher installed to compile and run the project
* You must have Gradle 6.7 or higher installed to build the project
* SonarQube is only required for code coverage

=== First Steps

The code generator does not create a Gradle wrapper, so create one:

```[shell]
gradle wrapper
```

==== Compile the Code

```[shell]
./gradlew build
```

==== Build with Code Coverage

Update the ```gradle.properties``` file and
set the `systemProp.sonar` properties to what's appropriate
for your environment.  Then run this command:

```[shell]
./gradlew clean build sonarqube
```

==== Build a Docker Image

```[shell]
./gradlew jibDockerBuild
```

==== Run the application in Docker (locally)

```[shell]
./gradlew bootBuildImage
cd docker-compose
docker-compose up -d
```

==== Setting Up SonarQube

Before code metrics can be exported to Sonarqube, the `gradle.properties` file
in this project must be updated with configuration values that match your environment.class

A local Sonarqube Docker container can be used. Generally, this command will suffice

```[shell]
docker run -d --name sonarqube -e SONAR_ES_BOOTSTRAP_CHECKS_DISABLE=true -p 9000:9000 sonarqube:latest
```

Once Sonarqube is running, login to https://localhost:9000 using the default credentials admin/admin.

You will be prompted to change the default password.  Whatever new password you select, update the
`gradle.properties` file with that password.  When that's done, the code metrics from this project can
be exported to the Sonarqube Docker container.

See
https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/setup/get-started-2-minutes/[Getting Started with Sonarqube in 2 Minutes]
and https://hub.docker.com/_/sonarqube[Running Sonarqube in Docker]

for additional information.

==== Check for the latest dependency updates
Ben Manes' `versions` plugin is included in the `build.gradle` file.
This plugin checks for new versions of any dependencies. To check, run

```[shell]
./gradlew dependencyUpdates
```
