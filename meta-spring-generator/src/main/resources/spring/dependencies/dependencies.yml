# If new entries are added here, the RestProjectTemplateModel class
# must be updated by adding an instance variable to hold the new entry.
# (Where to add this will be obvious by the many other instance variables
# that are present for this purpose.)
# The TemplateRenditionTests may also need to be updated. That suite contains
# a nested test, BuildDotGradleTest, that uses fake dependency data.
# The fake data _may_ need to be updated to provide any new property added
# here. If the BuildDotGradleTest fails because a template property is
# undefined, then update BuildDotGradleTest's fake data.
